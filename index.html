<h2>Biography</h2>

<p>
Xiong Jingang is a professor and PhD supervisor at Beijing Normal University. 
His research focuses on nonlinear analysis and partial differential equations. 
He solved the regularity conjecture for the fast diffusion equation proposed by 
Berryman and Holland (1980), studied singular structures in Monge–Ampère and Yamabe equations, 
and initiated research on critical nonlinear problems such as the nonlocal Nirenberg problem.
</p>

<p>
He has published over 40 papers in leading international journals including 
<i>American Journal of Mathematics</i>, 
<i>Journal of the European Mathematical Society</i>, 
<i>Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik</i>, 
and <i>Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society</i>.
